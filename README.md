# ðŸš€ ReactJS Learning Journey - Day 18

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered
- *Functions as Props in React*
  - Passing functions to child components as props
  - Allowing child components to communicate with parent
  - Example: Handling events from child and updating parent state

- *Uncontrolled Components with useRef*
  - Managing input fields directly with ref
  - Difference between controlled and uncontrolled inputs
  - Practical scenarios for uncontrolled components

## âœ… Practice Questions (Solved)

### Q1: Simple Input with Ref
- Create a text input using useRef
- On button click, show value in alert

### Q2: Default Value Form
- Input with defaultValue
- On button click, display value in paragraph

## ðŸ“š Key Learnings
- Passing *functions as props* enables parent-child communication
- *Uncontrolled components* are useful when you donâ€™t need React state to manage form values
- useRef provides direct access to DOM elements
- Validations can still be applied even with uncontrolled inputs
- Mixed forms (controlled + uncontrolled) are common in real-world apps

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- React.js
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- JSX
- useRef, useState hooks
